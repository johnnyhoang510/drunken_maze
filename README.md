# DrunkenMaze

DrunkenMaze is a single player game where the user is tasked with navigating the character out of the maze. The main obstacles are that the character has limited visibility and a health bar that is gradually decreasing. The user can pick up items along the way to replenish health, but if the health bar reaches 0 before they can make it out of the maze and into the taxi to get home, you lose!
